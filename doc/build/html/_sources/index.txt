Introduction
============

This library is concerned with simulating the decoding of topological
quantum error-correcting codes. This is useful for determining their threshold error rates and logical error rates in the regime where useful error correction can be performed. In order to simulate the act of decoding, the following components are necessary:

 + asd
 + asd
